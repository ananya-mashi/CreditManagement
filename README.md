 It is very important to have good credit management for efficient cash flow.

• It is process of monitoring and collecting payments from customers.

• I have designed and developed such credit management system in which ,one user can view a specific user and can transfer an amount of money to another user within a limit, and admin can view all transaction history between multiple users.
